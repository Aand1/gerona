Launch the navigation.launch in addition to the
highlevel_dummy node, which can be used, to set navigation goals in Rviz.

The higlevel_dummy simply listens for goals set in Rviz and passes them to
path_control using the action interface. It is thus good for testing and 
demonstrating the navigation framework.
